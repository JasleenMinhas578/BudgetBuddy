## Methodology

We are following the **Agile Software Development** methodology, using an iterative sprint-based approach.  
- Work is divided into 5 sprints (2 weeks each), with clear milestones.  
- GitHub Projects, Issues, and Milestones are used for sprint planning and tracking.  
- Each feature is implemented incrementally, tested with unit/system tests, and refined based on feedback.  
- Continuous Integration (CI) is set up to ensure all commits are validated before merging.
